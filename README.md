# Wasteagram

Wasteagram is an Instragram-style mobile app created using Flutter SDK that allows food service workers to document food waste at the end of each shift by taking or uploading a photo of wasted food and inputting the quantity of food inventory wasted. The current date and device location are also captured with the new post. Data is stored in Google Firebase Cloud Firestore, and images are stored in Google Firebase Cloud Storage.
